In this study, we derive an empirical equation to simplify the relationship between seismic power spectral density (PSD) and bedload flux based on the physics-based model. We then hypothesize that adding seismic PSD as a new predictor improves hydraulics-based equation in terms of predicting bedload flux. We then test this newly derived empirical equation that combines the PSD and excess shear stress to predict bedload flux in a sandy-gravel-bed alluvial river. Our proposed equation predicts bedload flux better than either using PSD or shear stress alone. We further validate this equation with independent flow events and demonstrate that the newly derived empirical equation could potentially improve the predictive capability of bedload flux.

## Flash floods at the Arroyo de Los Pinos
During the monsoon season, we chased flash floods at the arroyo de los Pinos to study both sediment transport in ephemeral channels and rainfall-runoff across the basin. We set up an array of instrumentation network from upstream to downstream, including rain gauges, level loggers, seismometer to obtain meteorological, seismic, hydraulic, and sediment data. Here is an example of a flood event at the watershed.
