I just reached one of my targets of getting 2000 elo (rapid) on chess.com! Playing chess is fun, though it's sometimes frustrating, even devastating in a few situations. I blundered a lot to learn how to play it. 

I started to play chess two years ago. Even I already know some basics in chess, but I decided to start from scratch at 400 elo. Then gradually, I improve my tactics, and develop some understand of opening theory, and tricks as well.

Honestly, I still don’t know much about openings. As black, I usually play the Indian or Sicilian defenses, and as White, I like to go for the Queen’s gambit. Sometimes, I play King's gambit or Italian opening, but I often end up losing the games. London system is a solid opening, but I don't play it very often.
