I just reached one of my targets of getting 2000 elo (rapid) on chess.com! Playing chess is fun, though it's sometimes frustrating, even devastating in a few situations when you blunder in a winning position or run out of time. I blundered a lot to learn how to play it. 

I think the tactics to get 2000 elo is to minimize blunders as much as possible, especially when you don't have a clear plan or strategy. Your opponents will eventually blunder at some point in the game anyway :)😄! And your job is simply to punish their mistakes.

I started to play chess two years ago. Even I already know some basics in chess, but I decided to start from scratch at 400 elo. Then gradually, I improve my tactics, and develop some understand of opening theory, and tricks as well. Chess is not easy for a beginner, it takes time to learn and develop a basic understanding and position and coordination of pieces. 

Honestly, I still don’t know much about openings. As black, I usually play the Indian or Sicilian defenses, and as White, I like to go for the Queen’s gambit. Sometimes, I play King's gambit or Italian opening, but I often end up losing the games. Either I get too aggressive, or I mix up the positions and suddenly my king is the one being attacked. London system is a solid opening, but I don't play it very often.
