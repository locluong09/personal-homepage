I've recently finished my fourth 50k run this year. I guess I should to write a bit about this journey of long-distance running. 

Well, I started running quite a long ago, back when I was doing my bachelor in Vietnam around 2012 or 2013. Back then, I usually ran around 3 to 5 km a few times a week. I also played though, and which probably helped. 

When I came to the US, I still kept running around campus a few times a week, just to keep in shape and probably for running better at soccer games. I play soccers with friends, local Socorro people, and New Mexico Tech professor every Tuesday and Thursday and still keep it up until now. Sometimes, I also join a game on Wednesday morning mainly with Tech faculty. 

Probably, the reason why I decided to run 50k, which is considered an ultra-marathon race, was because of my office-and-research-mate, Mitchell, who is definitely an ultra-marathon runner. He regularly runs 50k, 100k, and 100 miles every year, and he runs a lot everyday. So, I thought I can try to run 50k to see if I can do it or not. 

It turns out to be very good for me at my first 50k climbing the Taylor mountain in Grants, NM. Surely, running any 50k in rough terran is really tough, challenging, and brutal, but at the end it was really satisfied. It's like I just achieved something when finishing the races. And I don't know if I can keep it up in the future. Let's see!
