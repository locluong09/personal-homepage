      I study water movements both on the surface and underground using computational modeling, numerical and inversion methods. My main focus during my PhD was to develop a new/modified physics-based model to quantify bedload transport in ephemeral rivers using seismic methods. The idea is to use seismic noise generated by the movement of bedload particles to quantify how much bedload is moving given the amount of seismic energy we can record from a nearby sensor. Currently, I am a postdoc working on snow modeling (developing physics-based models and data assimilation/remote sensing techniques to improve snow representation). This research is part of a larger effort to improve climate models and climate projections.
      This is my personal site where I store research projects and ideas, as well as some random thoughts. If you would like to collaborate or discuss any ideas, don't hesitate to drop me an email at loc.k.luong@gmail.com!.
