    <p class="text-justify px-100">I study water movements both on the surface and underground using computational modeling, numerical and inversion methods. My main focus during my PhD program is to develop a new/modified physics-based model to quantify bedload transport in ephemeral rivers using seismic methods. The idea is to use seismic noise generated by the movement of bedload particles to quantify how much bedload is moving given the amount of seismic energy we can record from a nearby sensor. This is my personal site where I store some "random thoughts", as well as some research projects and ideas. If you would like to collaborate or discuss any ideas, don't hesitate to drop me an email at loc.k.luong@gmail.com!
